<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yesterday I came up with an idea when I was roaming around on GitHub. Looking at the avatar of my GitHub account, I thought what does it really mean. After some research I knew it actually means something and has a name. Identicon, which basically is the combination of identity and icon, is your unique avatar that contains your personal information. There is a kind of way of encrypting the information into a&nbsp;series&nbsp;of rambling characters that almost means nothing called SHA hashing. Using this way of hashing, a string can be converted into a several byte codes of specific length and therefore we can actually fill in the 5 by 5 square avatar according to the byte codes'&nbsp;positivity. If it is positive we fill in the block with color and leave it empty otherwise. In order to make sure the avatar is symmetrical and therefore better looking, we only do the left three columns and make the mirror of left two columns and apply it to the right two. I think the number of generated byte codes are 20, and I only use the first 15 of them. I wrote <a href="https://github.com/lancevalour/Identicon/blob/master/src/yicheng/java/identicon/Identicon.java#L64-76"><span style="color: #e06666;">a wrapper class</span></a> of generating the identicon and the output of my name turned&nbsp;out to be very like the letter Y, which can very well personalize me because Y is my initial. Very interesting indeed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i1WwduSty3E/VLipUXnz3hI/AAAAAAAAAH8/E1etqpO_vuw/s1600/Capture.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i1WwduSty3E/VLipUXnz3hI/AAAAAAAAAH8/E1etqpO_vuw/s1600/Capture.PNG" height="299" width="320" /></a></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span id="goog_525568512"></span><span id="goog_525568513"></span></span>
