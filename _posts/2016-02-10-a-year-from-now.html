title: A Year From Now

---
<p>
	It's been a year since I started working as a software developer. A year from now I was green and didn't know much. After a year I say I still don't know much. But there is a difference. The typical adventure everyone has to go through in life is like, first you know nothing about everything, next you know something about everything, then you think you know everything about everything, and it turns out that everything is nothing. But you still gain somthing, you still grow up strong and be capable of handling the sophistication of everything. <br><br>

	The software world is changing fast, every day there are tons of new frameworks coming out, new tools making people roar. Sometimes you take a lot of time selecting those frameworks and get confused. Therefore the ability to dinstinguish between those tools and technologies is an essential skill for a software engineer. There are two different dimensions of software engineering. In the vertical dimension, it's about pursuing the most optimized algorithm and making the most of limited resources. In the horizontal dimension, it's about robustly scaling the system and architecture. The first one requires a lot of knowledge in algorithms and scientific research. The second one requires experience in system design and engineering practice. A good engineer has to know how to achieve something robustly and efficiently. And he also should have a vision for larger picture, for architecture and scale. David Heinemeier Hansson said we should not call ourselves software engineer but software writer. I believe what he said and agree with that. Most people are just writer instead of engineer, because engineer is about more than just writing a lot of code. <br><br>

	Design is important and it is hard. A good design makes life easier and makes more profit. Engieering design requires practice and experience in real works and projects. Graphical design requires knowledge of art and training but more taste and vision of beauty. Material Design is something that is well documented, well structured framework for design. It normalizes the randomness and difference of design style and is a good thing for developers. Because developers love normalization and uniqueness. It lowers the barrier of the world of professional designers and artists and makes design universal and easy to adapt. <br><br>

	As I learn more, I am more confident when dealing with problems because I have more tools and options to use. I also find out that happiness is actually pretty simple. A small thing can make me happy, like finding a bug in my code, or it is snowing today. And I think to my self, I actually don't need whole lot of things to be happy. I have a laptop that can do anything, a car that takes me to anywhere, a camera that records my life. I can't think of anything else I need to be happy. Oh a TV? I can have one but it makes me indulgent. So happiness is pretty simple, and what I have is already plentiful and I am thankful for that. The meaning of life is to find something, find something meanningful, find something to do. Catching up with the latest technologies and adapt them to something useful is one thing. Exploring my interests and pursuing the happiness is another thing. And I will find something meaningful in them.

	I played the game The Last Of Us recently. I think it's already far beyond the game itself. In the end Joel said to Ellie, "No matter what, you keep finding something to fight for." <br><br>

	I think that's exactly what I want to say to myself.<br><br>
