<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I somehow couldn't sleep at last night, switching TV channels again and again. Then I saw Mickey Rourke's twisted face with a white top hat and it caught my attention instantly. He was walking alone in suit like a poor and abandoned jazz player in 80's. The color of the scene was so ethereal and vague and it gave me kind of feeling that it might be an pretty old movie. Then the screen suddenly lit up when Mickey saw a woman standing behind the exhibition glass with a pair of wings waving on her back and it caught my attention massively. I felt like I've seen that woman in other films but couldn't remember who she is and the wing on her back was just making her look like a heavenly angel. After a series of boring plots played, the beautiful woman eventually carried Mickey with her flying in the sky and the last scene of the film revealed the truth that Mickey actually saw his body lying in the desert as they flew over. I think that ending as well as the angel girl might be the only highlight of the film and besides these this film was the worst film I have ever seen. When the credit of the film showed, I saw the actress's name and it was Megan Fox as expected. I knew that the director wanted to plot a story of the lightning before death but there was no clue at all for me why should put a woman with real wing into that. Metaphor of something or just director's wired fantasy? I just don't get it. But what I get is that Megan Fox's pretty face became the fantasy in my dream.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today I search about the film and what makes me more surprised is that this film is a 2010 year production and it looks like 1980. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396221/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><span style="color: #e06666;">IMDb</span></a> score is 5 out of 10 and I think it is unsurprising at all and pretty decent.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
