All time I was doing software stuff until two weeks ago. I was told to help with the embedded. I was a little worried at the beginning and more frustrated later on. For a software engineer who likes mobile and web, such thing could be a nightmare. <br><br>

I was struggling looking into documentations like it's never ended. I was in an abyss of desperation and banishment feeling I was never gonna come back. I feel alone and sad. Not only because it is hard to grasp but because no one is giving me any instructions.<br><br>

And one day after a 12 hour sleep since last night. I feel something. First of all I feel energetic than days ago and ready to meet the challenge. Then I feel I have an impulse to talk with people. So I ask my colleague from another team for help. I schedule a meeting with him afternoon and he is really eager to help. <br><br>

We discuss a lot and he taught me a lot. And after the meeting both he and I are happy and satified. So I know that it is not that people don't want to help. And you can't expect everyone knows what pitfall you are in or what problems you have. No one is your bellyworm. You can't take it for granted. What's more, communication can really make people feel happy and more motivated. If it is your thing which is tough, you have to take the initiative. You have to ask first before everyone tries to help you. But only on the premise that you have questions and the right questions to ask. So before that you have to know what the questions are and how to ask them.<br><br>

So I think even if I was intended to help rather than solve, I should try to do the best and save time for others. And I believe difficulties are temporary and what you learned are perpatual. A few takeaways from my work experience will be:<br><br>

1. Ask, ask right.<br><br>

2. Don't take everything for granted. <br><br>

3. Be bold and modest.<br><br>

4. Have good sleep.<br><br>

5. Last but not least:<br><br>

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.<br><br>
