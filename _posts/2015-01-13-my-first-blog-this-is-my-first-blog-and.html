<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is my first blog and it is a good sign of the advent of my everyday writing habit. I will probably write mainly in English and sometimes in Chinese. Topics may vary from technical experiences to daily life. An<span style="color: #ea9999;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #e06666;"><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs" target="_blank"><span style="color: #e06666;">article</span></a>&nbsp;</span>that strikes me talks about how important it is to keep blogging as a habit. It kind of reminds me of the old days that I first touched blogging in my middle school. It was called QQ Space. Actually it was a part of extension of QQ IM app and I just wrote something there and I felt pretty cool. It was basically all meaningless sentimental words that portraits a fifteen year old teenager inside world and I now look back and feel like pretty stupid but still want to get back if there is a time machine. In future I think blogging will be sort of my personal journal which keeps track of my thought and memory which is a good thing. Also it is a good way to write down some technical issues and problems to keep me alert every now and then. I will definitely forget how to write with a pen as I stroke more and more keyboard and I don't think it is something bad. At least it will help my fingers become more flexible which is a good thing when I am coding most of the day. I can also pick up my habit back in undergraduate when I like to write some piece of fictions every now and then. What's different from that time is that now I have grasp another tool to express myself by coding and I believe those two things, writing and coding, are essentially the same thing, they are the carriers of the thought. Code can be more concrete by defining clear structure and naming properly and writing can be abstract if you disassemble the structure of the article and using vague words. After all, the brain is the master of both kinds of work and they can't get out of the barriers set by ourselves.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Anyway, today is start of something new, perhaps I will see after ten years.</span><br /><br /></div>
