I am Yicheng, software engineer at [FARO Technologies](http://www.faro.com). I work mainly on Android and Java. I develop apps and hack phones and tablets.  

I graduated from [The Ohio State University](http://www.osu.edu) in Ohio and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in China. 

I shoot [videos and mash movie clips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBsGyxkyzV9lrBvPGNRrVGQ). I take [photos](https://500px.com/{{ site.500px_username }}) as I go.
